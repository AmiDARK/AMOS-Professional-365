# On a personal note - I was 'Mia' on ultimateamiga.co.uk for a while - but after my work was blocked that team I did a background check and then ran away as fast as I could.

Any real developers who are interested in this project please get in touch, it is 68k Assembly and unique in design - I am still interested in working on it and have not dumped it as suggested by "them" - I was ready to do a clean re-release (still am actually), I waited a while to see if anything happened, but all I saw was continual insults and accusations against me even though I DID THE WORK TO GET AMOS REBUILT NOT THEM - I tried my best to integrate with them but it was impossible and became painful for me I'm also a very busy person and can't be bothered with toy ideas - practical application only - they still have not produced anything at all and have claimed AMOS for themselves and have blocked everyone else, their bug lists and plans are just stupid and they are playing a game with themselves - I have not seen any new AMOS programs made by that so called team, and their feature ideas won't help and won't get used by anyone... Please, AMOS is the last Imperative Programming language that is any use, it is actually very powerful - it runs like an operating system on its own and is beautiful architecture. I don't do Social Media, but I do do AMOS programming when I can. I probably should have contacted Francois myself instead of trying to integrate with them, but I'm actually very shy. But this has not disappeared and if I could get some support I could easily get the re-release up in a few weeks by myself - but there seem little point without anyone actually using it - the amount of work I put into this justifies my decision.

# AMOS Professional

based on the original 68000 source code by FranÃ§ois Lionet

# History
Some years ago there was discussion of re-development, but the work mentioned in [this article](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html) was not made public, any collaborative efforts have disappeared. An archive was made available at a later date but was partially incomplete and difficult to build - this project fixes the build problems, but has no relation to any previous plans or news releases.

# AMOS PRO goes Public Domain!

> [01 dec 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20130530022407/http://www.pianetaamiga.it)
In occasion of Pianeta Amiga 2012, Pietro Ghizzoni, current owner of AMOS Pro sources after Francois Lionet ceased development, has kindly agreed to release them as Public Domain. You can download the full package in advance from this link. Sources will be also put on Aminet in the next days.

# AMOS present and future

> [pre Public Domain ?](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html)
As you know some months ago i've obtained the AMOS sources... during these months I've spent my time learning the AMOS internal functions and structures, in order to upgrade it and develop the new AMOSPro V3... but I've to say that my projects have changed a lot during this period. My original idea was to upgrade/expand it, add AGA support and most of all to make AMOS more OS friendly! but when I examined the sources some problems have arisen...
